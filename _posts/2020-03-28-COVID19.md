These days everyone is talking about COVID-19. So are we, but not right now. 

Right now we are all at home trying our best to set up the perfect workstation and desk environment to get some stuff done!

All you need is a few monitors, a decent laptop, a fast internet connection and.... you need a decent sense of commitment, self-control and humor, plus massive amounts of coffee! With group meetings, social events and virtual working places, all going online in these times, we are finally using more of the technology established for easing the life of traveling or locked up scientists (Zoom, VNC, ssh, TeamViewer, Google Colab, tmux etc.). It is actually a great development in that respect. 

To all hardworking home-officers out there, stay sane!

Fritz
