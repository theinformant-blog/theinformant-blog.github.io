Last week Berlin got to host a brave group of researchers working on collective behavior.  Despite some corona-caused turbulence, most attendees got to enjoy 3 days packed with experimental results & modeling of groups of individuals in real-life. The collective information processing (CIP) workshop was organized by SCIoIs own Pawel Romanzcuk. Due to his outstanding efforts most of the speakers which could not make it in person got to give their presentations remotely. Welcome to the 21st century and the future of scientific exchange. The program included a series of invited talks, smaller plenary talk contributions, a poster and lots of opportunities to exchange ideas.

Here are three of my personal highlights include the following:

### David Bierbachâ€˜s (HU Berlin) talk on collective diving behavior & how to address the heterogeneity of individuals

David discussed two of his recent projects and how they aim to address the why and how of behavioral ethology. First, he outlined the â€žMexico systemâ€œ and the predator deterrence of Poecelia Sulphuria. This species lives in water with a high concentration of sulfur. This forces them to breath at the surface. But from time to time one can observe synchronized diving behaviors going through the collective. This happens spontaneously and is often time associated with an attack by bird.  Interestingly, the diving does not actually increase the escape success rate. Instead, it simply reduces the attack frequency of the flying predator.  He then went on to discuss the importance of manipulation and the RoboFish project. While observation and traditional modeling can provide insights, they are limited in truly pinning down the mechanisms that drive collective behavior. Therefore, Bierbach and collegeaues developed a fish-like robotic unit which can be controlled to produce open and closed-loop behavior. It allows to investigate the emergence of leadership behavior using different iterative approach behaviors and the analysis of inter-individual differences. Pretty cool, right?

### Iain Couzinâ€˜s (MPI Konstanz) talk on the importance of criticality in decision making and â€žThe VR Matrixâ€œ

Next up was the invited talk by Iain Couzin from the MPI in Konstanz. One major problem with the robotic fish system introduced previously is that is hard to scale (multiple non-interfering robo units) and require a lot of experimental setup. Holographic virtual reality, on the other hand, is easier to maintain and allows the manipulation of many different illusions. By simply projecting holograms into the tank one can control sensory inputs and create a form of â€žmatrixâ€œ. Couzin then went on to put the behavioral ethology tools of the 21st century to use in a special context: Criticality and susceptibility in collective decision making. In Physics criticality describes a state of a system close to bifurcation. A small input perturbation may then lead to a rapid winner-take-all response. This has inspired a set of modeling theories in computational neuroscience including ring attractor networks. In a series of experiments which ranged from drosophila, fish, locusts and baboons he showed that indeed group decisions appear to follow a similar sensitivity to sensory input. Furthermore, this can be generalized to more than two options and then breaks down the process into a set of binary decisions.

### Bill Warrenâ€˜s (Brown University) talk on collective visual processing in human crowds and VR manipulations

I find it fascinating when I get to listen to talks which accumulated research results from a decade (or more) of research dedicated to a specific problem. Traditional models of collective motion neglect the notion of vision instead focus on velocity-based pooling (e.g. the classical 3-zone Couzin model). Bill, on the other hand, felt like this entirely neglects importance of local interactions guided by vision. This led to a series of VR experiments aimed to identify the underlying rules and neighborhood of interaction. In VR it is easy to setup controlled perturbations to investigate their causal effects. In his talk he highlighted a set of results focused on the importance of optical flow and occlusion. He showed that cancelling the relative rate of expansion of agents in non-occluded proximity and the angular velocity provides the best model fit in a Bayesian model comparison setup. Furthermore, he investigated the nature of interactions (metric vs. topological). Again, using VR they could perturb the density of neighbors and found evidence for soft metric interactions which respect occlusion.

All in all, 3 enlightening days with quite a lot of new knowledge. Conclusion: Berlin is an awesome and globally connected place to study collective behavior and to exchange ðŸ¤—. Thank you very much for the great organization and see you at the next CIP!
