As of September 2019 the excellence cluster “Science of Intelligence” was brought to life with the arrival of the very first cohort of graduate and post-graduate students at the main campus of the Technical University in Berlin. The interdisciplinary initiative was formed in order to tackle the fundamental aspects of knowledge and understand what we mean by intelligence. To do so, proponents from vastly different fields, such as robotics, informatics, psychology, physics and biology, all loosely working on some form of intelligent system, have now set out to tackle this quest.

To date, substantial work has been conducted on this topic, yet has lead to people still having mixed and unclear interpretations of the matter. Intuitively you might have a sense of what makes an object, algorithm, animal or robot intelligent, but how can this be formulated in a universal way? Previously suggested aspects such as brain size, network connectivity, behavioural repertoire, adaptivity or robustness all hold some truth to them, yet seemingly cannot be summed up in a single scientific approach.

In order to address the question of intelligence, one might first want to break the complex issue down into smaller, more accessible and quantifyiable aspects of the matter, such as, for example information. Information-theoretical pioneers Claude E. Shannon, Alan Turing and others established the idea, that information is a property that is encoded in signals and that can readily be acquired and it’s content be measured. Knowing the information content, the required computational necessities can be addressed leading us further down the worm hole. Properties such as information are universal and can be found in vastly different systems ranging from an animal’s sensory input and the weights defined in deep neural networks to bits encoded in a configuration of armor tiles of a robot on a distant planet.

Within the cluster of “Science of Intelligence”, we are all addressing this unifying  questions from our own perspective and with our own research background, yet are fortunate enough to be able to do so on a common ground. We have joined this cluster, due to the fact that is represents a collective and interdisciplinary approach to unify science in an unprecedented and new way.

Not only is it of interest to understand intelligent systems for the sake of reproducing them to our own use, but also to acquire a more universal understanding of what makes life on earth so special. This is what we are here for, and this is what we want to share with you.

The blog “The Informant” is an project by PhD and post-graduate students, which is not directly linked to “Science of Intelligence” by means of funding or content. More specifically the idea behind this platform was for us as scientists, to be able to share our everyday experience and anecdotal information with a broader, more general public audience. Further the idea is to have an output channel that is more accessible and unrefined, in order to break down some of the knowledge barriers that we face today and that limit information flow and trust amongst us!
